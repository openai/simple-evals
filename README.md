# Overview

This repository contains a lightweight library for evaluating language models.
We are open sourcing it so we can be transparent about the accuracy numbers we're publishing alongside our latest models.

## Background

Evals are sensitive to prompting, and there's significant variation in the formulations used in recent publications and libraries.
Some use few-shot prompts or role playing prompts ("You are an expert software programmer...").
These approaches are carryovers from evaluating _base models_ (rather than instruction/chat-tuned models) and from models that were worse at following instructions.

For this library, we are emphasizing the _zero-shot, chain-of-thought_ setting, with simple instructions like "Solve the following multiple choice problem". We believe that this prompting technique is a better reflection of the models' performance in realistic usage.

**We will not be actively maintaining this repository and monitoring PRs and Issues.** In particular, we're not accepting new evals. Here are the changes we might accept.

- Bug fixes (hopefully not needed!)
- Adding adapters for new models
- Adding new rows to the table below with eval results, given new models and new system prompts.

This repository is NOT intended as a replacement for https://github.com/openai/evals, which is designed to be a comprehensive collection of a large number of evals.

## Evals

This repository currently contains the following evals:

- MMLU: Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding, reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300, https://github.com/hendrycks/test, [MIT License](https://github.com/hendrycks/test/blob/master/LICENSE)

- MGSM: Multilingual Grade School Math Benchmark (MGSM), Language Models are Multilingual Chain-of-Thought Reasoners, reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03057, https://github.com/google-research/url-nlp, [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (CC-BY)](https://github.com/google-research/url-nlp/blob/main/LICENSE)
- HumanEval: Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code, reference https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374, https://github.com/openai/human-eval, [MIT License](https://github.com/openai/human-eval/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Samplers

We have implemented sampling interfaces for the following language model APIs:

- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview
- Claude: https://www.anthropic.com/api

Make sure to set the `*_API_KEY` environment variables before using these APIs.

## Setup

Due to the optional dependencies, we're not providing a unified setup mechanism. Instead, we're providing instructions for each eval and sampler.

For [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval/) (python programming)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openai/human-eval
pip install -e human-eval
```

For the [OpenAI API](https://pypi.org/project/openai/):

```bash
pip install openai
```

For the [Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/quickstart-guide):

```bash
pip install anthropic
```

For the [xAI API](https://docs.x.ai/docs/overview):

```bash
pip install openai
export XAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Running the evals

```bash
python -m simple-evals.simple_evals --list-models
```

This will list all the models that you can evaluate.

To run the evaluations, you can use the following command:

```bash
python -m simple-evals.simple_evals --model <model_name> --examples <num_examples>
```

This will launch evaluations through the OpenAI API.
